# Introduction

This project analyzes global climate classification changes by comparing climate data from a recent period (2015–2024) with the WMO Climatological Reference Period (1961–1990).

The analysis will be done by applying the Köppen-Trewartha climate classification system to downloaded ERA5 climate data, analyzing and visualizing the climate classification shifts that have already occurred.

## Process

1. **Download ERA5 Data**
  + Download and save ERA5 climate reanalysis datasets.
2. **Aggregate Climate Variables**
  + Compute climate period averages (temperature & precipitation).
3. **Derive Classification Determinants**
  + Derive aggregate seasonal/annual statistics required for classification.
4. **Assign Köppen-Trewartha Climate Types**
  + Apply Köppen-Trewartha classification definitions to all grid cells.  
5. **Analyze Classification Changes**
  + Identify and visualize classification changes between periods.
