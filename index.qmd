## Overview

This project uses a multi-stage pipeline::

1. **Download ERA5 Data** – 
  + Download and save ERA5 climate reanalysis datasets.
2. **Compute Climate Normals** – 
  + Calculate period climate averages (temperature & precipitation).
3. **Derive Classification Metrics** – 
  + Aggregate seasonal/annual statistics required for classification.
4. **Apply Climate Classification Systems** -
  + Categorize using the Koppen and Trewartha climate classification systems.
5. **Analyze Climate Group Changes** -
  + Calculate and visualize the climate group changes.

Use the sidebar to navigate, or read in order using the chapter links below.
